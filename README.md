# stock-picker

This is a small piece of function that takes an integer array as the argument - numbers imply stock price and the index means a day:
`[17,3,6,9,15,8,6,1,10]`

This function finds a pair of days where the capital gain you will get is the biggest and returns them as an array.
For example, in the input above, `[1, 4]` will be returned. The first index means the day that you should buy the stock and the second one is for the day that you should sell the stock to get as much capital gain as possible.
